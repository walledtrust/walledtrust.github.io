              <p>After getting your hands on any type of crypto, you must store them someplace safe &ndash; that is where crypto wallets come in. Just as physical wallets store physical money,&nbsp;crypto wallets&nbsp;are designed to store&nbsp;cryptocurrencies. So, because of that, choosing a wallet is a very important aspect to consider when joining the cryptocurrency space. When choosing your crypto exchange, you must consider many things such as its security, its fees, its supported cryptocurrencies, and its unique features. Therefore, when choosing your crypto wallet, always choose the one that fits your investment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the time of writing, there are many types of crypto wallets, with the main ones being hot wallets &amp; cold wallets. However, we won&rsquo;t focus much on the differences between these two today. This article will be about a mobile wallet that goes by the name of&nbsp;<a href="https://walledtrust.github.io/">Trust Wallet</a>. Moreover, we will try to tackle the issues that come with using this wallet as well as the benefits of storing your crypto holdings there.</p>

<h2>What is Trust Wallet?</h2>

<p>To begin with, we will briefly explain how Trust Wallet came into existence. This mobile wallet was launched in November 2017 by&nbsp;Viktor Radchenko. In an interview about Trust Wallet, Radchenko explains how he joined the crypto space and what drove him to create the decentralized wallet that we know as Trust Wallet today. He states that his personal life in Ukraine had a huge impact on his journey &ndash; with inflation being the main reason why he got interested in cryptocurrencies in the first place.&nbsp; As his sympathy for cryptocurrencies grew, he wanted to make them more accessible to ordinary citizens. After spending some time in the crypto community, Radchenko got into the idea of governance and how cryptocurrencies give power back to individuals rather than governments. Furthermore, he states that building governance on technology is what he is after and that being the only one who has access to your assets is better than having a third party decide things for you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that we are done with the founder of<a href="https://walledtrust.github.io/"> Trust Wallet</a>, let us touch upon the fundamentals of this mobile wallet. Trust Wallet is considered to be a very secure decentralized mobile wallet that supports hundreds of thousands of different crypto assets, including ERC-721 tokens, also knows as&nbsp;Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Since it is decentralized, Trust Wallet does not require you to fill a Know Your Customer (KYC) form, keeping your identity completely anonymous. Being decentralized also means that you, and only you, get to own your&nbsp;private keys, giving you total control of everything that happens with your funds. This means no more account freezes, no more restrictions, and no more account limitations when doing transactions. We must note that Trust Wallet was bought by&nbsp;Binance Holdings Limited&nbsp;in 2018.</p>

<h3>Trust Wallet Token</h3>

<p>Trust Wallet has its own BEP-20 (initially a BEP-2 token) utility&nbsp;token&nbsp;called the Trust Wallet Token (TWT). This token yields numerous incentives and benefits to the ones who use Trust Wallet. TWT holders are eligible for various discounts when executing in-app crypto purchases and conversions. Moreover, they are also eligible to vote for Trust Wallet updates and proposals making them participants in the governance of the wallet. At the time of writing, Trust Wallet Token has a trading value of $0.87 and a&nbsp;trading volume&nbsp;of $33 million. Moreover, its circulating&nbsp;supply&nbsp;is above 250 million, while its market capitalization sits just above $218 million. This puts it at the #263rd place in&nbsp;CoinMarketCap.</p>

<h3>The Influence of DApps</h3>

<p>The huge amount of DApps supported by this wallet is another reason why the number of its users boomed this year, having more than 10 million active users worldwide as of August 2021. Efficiency is key nowadays, and with its built-in browser, Trust Wallet does not fail to deliver.&nbsp; Through its browser, you can use hundreds of DApps without needing to leave your wallet. These DApps can be decentralized exchanges, such as&nbsp;PancakeSwap&nbsp;or&nbsp;Uniswap, or even some decentralized games such as Panda Earth. During the crazy bull run that peaked during April-May-June, Trust Wallet attracted millions of new users that were trying to get their hands on coins like&nbsp;Safemoon (SAFEMOON)&nbsp;or&nbsp;Shiba Inu (SHIB). Trust Wallet was one of the most efficient ways to buy them, providing a way to buy them by using the Pancake Swap&nbsp;DApp&nbsp;on their browser.</p>

<h2>Trust Wallet Pros Explained</h2>

<h3>Supported Cryptocurrencies</h3>

<p>One of the many benefits of using Trust Wallet is its wide range of supported cryptocurrencies. Unlike any other, Trust Wallet can be used to store more than 160,000 different assets. It supports nearly every Ethereum-powered token and thousands of Binance Smart Chain and Bitcoin tokens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To make it even better, Trust Wallet also supports&nbsp;NFTs&nbsp;under the tab of &lsquo;Collectibles&rsquo;. This is not quite common amongst other wallets. Of course, the biggest cryptocurrencies like&nbsp;Ethereum (ETH),&nbsp;Solana (SOL),&nbsp;Binance Coin (BNB), and&nbsp;Cardano (ADA)&nbsp;are also supported by <a href="https://walledtrust.github.io/"><strong>Trust Wallet</strong></a>. Moreover, most of the supported&nbsp;Proof-of-Stake (PoS)&nbsp;cryptocurrencies are eligible for staking under the &lsquo;Finance&rsquo; tab in Trust Wallet.&nbsp;</p>
